# Weather-Dashboard

A simple weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API.

## Description

This weather dashboard allows the user to search and display both the current weather and 5 day forecast by city name. Each search is saved to local storage and dynamically creates buttons for each city, allowing the user to easily review previous weather searches on click.

## Features

- Uses Open Weather API to generate both current and 5 day forecast.
- Weather details include the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- If the search bar is empty, an alert will tell the user to enter a city name.
- City buttons are created on search and when clicked, will again display the weather for that city.

## Future Development

- Improvements to be made for styling, theme, and layout.
- Icons to represent weather conditions will be implimented.

## Known Bugs

- Empty search bar alert is triggered twice in succession.
- Not a bug but the page is bland and even moreso with no search history. This is unintentional and will be addressed during the development stages for improving style and layout.
